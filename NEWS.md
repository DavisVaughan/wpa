# wpa 1.3.0

This is the first version of the **wpa** package to be released open-source on GitHub. If you have been using a previous developmental version, the main difference is that this release omits the more experimental _working patterns_ family of functions. The experimental functions are currently available upon request via mac@microsoft.com.
