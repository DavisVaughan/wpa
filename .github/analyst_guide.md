# Introduction

Welcome to the Analyst Guide of the **wpa** package. The objective of this document is to get you up an running with this library, and introduce you to the main functions that are included. 

## Before we begin...

Make sure you have:
1.  Analyst access to  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/workplace-analytics/"Workplace Analytics</a>
2.  Either <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> or <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download"> RStudio Desktop </a> installed in your local device

## Why use R for Workplace Analytics?

There are multiple reasons:

1. **Cutting edge data science**: R is an open-source language that is known for its active user community and a wide range of packages that together enable the quick and effective implementation of data science techniques
2. **Reproducibility**: Code-based workflows help facilitate reproducible analysis, which is the notion that analysis should be built in a way that is replicable by others. R as a tool promotes this good practice. 
3. **Efficiency / scalability**: R scales relatively well in the context of large datasets. The application of functions and automated processes also help cut down routine analysis time 
4. **Integration**: If you already use R as part of your analysis toolkit, adopting this package as part of the workflow will be seamless and easy
5. **Go beyond basic reporting**: One of the most appealing feature of R is the access it offers to a wide range of packages. For instance, clustering and text mining can be done very easily as part of a R workflow â€“ which are both available in this package

## Analyst Guide Contents

This guide is organized in six sections. 

1. **Getting Stared**: This section contains the detailed installation instructions, and a general overview of how functions work. 
2. **Summary Functions**: This section introduces functions that calculate averages and draw comparisons across groups.
3. **Distribution Functions**: This section describes functions that help you explore distributions across groups.
4. **Trend Functions**: This section explains functions that explore time dyanmics across a wide range of metrics.
5. **Network Functions**: This section explores functions that help you plot and analyse networks.
